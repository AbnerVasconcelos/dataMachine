# Industrial Machine Data Extraction System with MQTT and OPC UA Integration

>Status: Work in Progress ⚠️

## Description

The Industrial Machine Data Extraction System is an upcoming project aimed at extracting and collecting data from industrial machines that lack native technologies for data extraction. By leveraging the capabilities of an IoT gateway, this system aims to enable seamless integration with Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) and facilitate the extraction of valuable operational data.

The system will utilize two industry-standard protocols, MQTT and OPC UA, to establish communication channels between the industrial machine and the data extraction infrastructure. MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) will ensure efficient and reliable data transfer, allowing the machine to publish data to subscribed clients in a lightweight and scalable manner. OPC UA (Unified Architecture) will provide a secure and standardized interface for accessing real-time and historical data from the machine.

## Key Features (Planned)
<ul>
<li>Seamless integration with industrial machines lacking native data extraction capabilities</li>
<li>Utilizes an IoT gateway to bridge the communication gap between the machine and the data extraction system</li>
<li>Implements MQTT protocol for lightweight and scalable data transfer</li>
<li>Implements OPC UA protocol for secure and standardized access to real-time and historical data</li>
<li>Enables extraction of crucial operational data, such as temperature, pressure, production counts, and more </li>
<li>Supports flexible data collection intervals, allowing for real-time monitoring or periodic data capture</li>
<li>Provides customizable data visualization and reporting options for in-depth analysis </li>
<li>Facilitates the integration of extracted data with other systems, such as data analytics and predictive maintenance</li>
<li>This project is currently under development and not yet ready for production use. We are actively working on implementing the features and functionalities described above. Stay tuned for future updates on the progress and availability of the Industrial Machine Data Extraction System.</li>
